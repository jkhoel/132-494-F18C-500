## Notes:
Requires XeLaTex for typesetting!

## Re-use as template
This TeX project is designet to be easily modified/expanded or used as template for other airframes.

### ChecklistSetup.tex
Adjusts formatting to better suit checklists, and also declares commands for use in defining checklist sections, subsections, checklist items and comments.

### NormalProcedures.tex
Use this file as a template for creating new checklists. Should be prety self explanatory when comparing to the typeset PDF.
